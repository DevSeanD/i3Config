The goal of this repository is to aid others in the community as well as myself in configuring i3.
  Config build for Thinkpad X220T on Debian:
    Due to the two batteries on the X220T I add an additional slow for SLICE_BAT.

  In my i3/config file I have bluetooth disabled on start up.
  
  I hope that this is knowledge is helpful in helping you finetune your i3 experience.
